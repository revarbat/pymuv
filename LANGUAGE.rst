Comments
========

Comments can take one of two styles.  For single-line comments, you can use::

    // Single line comment.

For multi-line comments, you can use::

    /*
    multiple
    line
    comment
    */


Literals
========

Decimal integers are simple::

    123456789

Hexadecimal integers are prefixed with ``0x``::

    0x7ffc

Octal integers are prefixed with ``0o``::

    0o1234567

Binary integers are prefixed with ``0b``::

    0b11010100

You can also prefix decimal numbers with ``0d``, if you want to be pedantic::

    0d123456789

Floating point numbers are given like::

    3.14
    0.1
    3.
    1e9
    6.022e23
    1.6e-35

DataBase References (dbrefs) are given like::

    #12345
    #-1

All numbers, of any base, can have ``_`` placeholder characters, to make the
numbers more human readable, like thousands separators::

    123_456_789
    0xBAD_BEEF
    0b1101_0100
    0o12_345_678
    16_237.21
    #12_345

String literals are given like::

    "Hello!"

or::

    'Hiya!'

If you use triples of quotes for string delimiters, you can more easily
include single or double character quotes in the string::

    """It's a "test"."""

or:

    '''It's a "test".'''

To make it easier to give regexp patterns with backslashes, you can give
raw strings by preceeding a regular string of any type with a single ``r``.
Raw strings are not processed for backslash escaped characters::

    r"http://\([a-z0-9._-]+\)"
    r'http://\([a-z0-9._-]+\)'
    r"""http://\([a-z0-9._-]+\)"""
    r'''http://\([a-z0-9._-]+\)'''

List arrays can be declared like this::

    ["first", "second", "third"]

or::

    [1, 2, 4, 8]

Dictionaries (sometimes called hash tables, or associative arrays in other
languages) are declared like::

    [ "key1" => "val1", "key2" => "val2", "key3" => "val3" ]

To declare an empty dictionary, which is distinct from a list, use::

    [=>]


Global Variables
================

You can declare global variables at the toplevel scope like::

    var myglobal;
    var answer = 42;

The global variables ``me`` and ``loc`` are pre-defined for all programs.


Functions
=========

You can declare a function like this::

    func helloworld() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }

With arguments, you can declare it like this::

    func concatenate(var1, var2) {
        return strcat(var1, var2);
    }

If you need a variable number of arguments for a function, you can put a ``*``
after the last argument, to indicate that all extra arguments will by passed
as a list in the last argument variable::

    func concat(args*) {
        return array_interpret(args);
    }

If you need to declare a ``public`` function, that can be called by name from
other MUF programs, you can declare it like this::

    public func concat(args*) {
        return array_interpret(args);
    }

Functions return the value given to the ``return`` command.  ie: ``return 42;``
will return the integer value ``42`` from the function.  If the end of the
function is reached with no ``return`` executing, then the function will return
the integer ``0``.


Calls
=====

You can call functions you have declared, and many builtin MUF primitives in
this way::

    myvar = myfunction(5, "John Doe");
    notify(me, "Hello World!");

If a MUF primitive would return more than one argument on the stack, the MUV
counterpart will return all those values in a list.


Function Variables
==================

You can declare extra variables in function scope like this::

    func myfunction() {
        var myvar;
        var fifth = "5th";
        ...
    }

Variables can be declared in block scopes within functions, and will be in
effect only within those blocks.  You can even declare variables of the same
name within different scopes::

    func myfunction() {
        var x = "C";
        for (var x in ["F", "A", "D"]) {
            if (x eq "A") {
            tell(x);
                var x = "B";
            tell(x);
            }
        }
        tell(x);
    }

will output the following::

    A
    B
    C


Constants
=========

You can declare constants using the syntax::

    const PI = 3.14159;

By convention, the constant name should be all uppercase.


Built-Ins
=========

MUV has several built-in commands available to all programs:

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|      Function       |                     Description                      |
+=====================+======================================================+
| ``abort(msg)``      | Throws a user exception with the given ``msg``.      |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``throw(msg)``      | The same as ``abort(msg)``                           |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``tell(msg)``       | The same as ``notify(me, msg)``                      |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``count(arr)``      | Returns the count of how many items are in an array. |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``cat(...)``        | Converts all args to strings and concatenates them.  |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``haskey(key,arr)`` | Evaluates true if ``key`` is in the array ``arr``.   |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+

MUV also has some built-in constants:

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
|      Constant       |                     Description                      |
+=====================+======================================================+
| ``true``            | ``1`` (Evaluates as true.)                           |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| ``false``           | ``0`` (Evaluates as false.)                          |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------+


Namespaces
==========

If you declare global variables and function within a namespace block, then
those variables and functions become part of that namespace::

    namespace math {
        const PI = 3.14159;
    }

Will define the constant ``math::PI``.  To refer to that variable, you will
need to either use the ``math::`` prefix, or specify that you want to use that
namespace like this::

    using namespace math;

Here's more examples::

    namespace math {
        const PI = 3.14159;
        func rad2deg(x) {
            return x*180.0/PI;
        }
    }
    func thirdpi() {
        return math::rad2deg(math::PI/3.0);
    }
    using namespace math;
    func halfpi() {
        return rad2deg(PI/2.0);
    }


Includes
========

You can include the code from other MUV files by using the ``include`` command::

    include "otherfile.muv";

You can include standard MUV files by preceeding the filename with a ``!``.
This tells ``include`` to look for the file in the system-wide MUV includes
directory, which is usually in ``/us/local/share/muv/incls``.

One important standard include file is ``!fb6/prims``::

    include "!fb6/prims";

If you include ``!fb6/prims`` in your file, you will get all the standard FB6
MUF primitives declared for MUV to use.  These primitives will be declared
with exactly the same names as they have in MUF, with the same argument
ordering.  The only exceptions are:

+------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
|     MUF Name     |      MUV Name      |                Change                   |
+==================+====================+=========================================+
| ``name-ok?``     | ``name_ok?()``     | Dash in name replaced with underscore.  |
+------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| ``pname-ok?``    | ``pname_ok?()``    | Dash in name replaced with underscore.  |
+------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| ``ext-name-ok?`` | ``ext_name_ok?()`` | Dashes in name replaced with underscore.|
+------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+
| ``fmtstring``    | ``fmtstring()``    | Argument ordering completely reversed.  |
+------------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+

Since MUF has kind of a messy namespace, you can *instead* include files with
just the primitives you need, renamed a bit more sensibly.  For example, if
you include the file ``!fb6/obj`` You can get access to the standard fb6 object
related primitives, renamed into the ``obj`` namespace such that MUF primitives
like ``name`` and ``set`` are renamed to ``obj::name()`` and ``obj::set()``, leading
to far less namespace polution.  The standard namespaced include files are as
follows, in order of likely importance:

+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
|   Include File   |   NameSpace    |              What it declares               |
+==================+================+=============================================+
| ``fb6/stdlib``   |                | ``trig``, ``caller``, ``prog``, ``version``.|
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/match``    |                | ``match_noisy``, ``match_controlled``       |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/io``       | ``io::``       | ``notify`` and ``read`` type primitives.    |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/type``     | ``type::``     | Type checking and conversion primitives.    |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/str``      | ``str::``      | String manipulation primitives.             |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/ansi``     | ``ansi::``     | ANSI color code string primitives.          |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/regex``    | ``regex::``    | Regular expression primitives.              |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/math``     | ``math::``     | Floating point and integer math prims.      |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+

+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+

+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/lock``     | ``lock::``     | Lock related primitives.                    |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/conn``     | ``conn::``     | Connection based primitives.                |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/descr``    | ``descr::``    | Descriptor based connection primitives.     |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/event``    | ``event::``    | Event handling primitives.                  |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/mcp``      | ``mcp::``      | MCP client-server protocol prims.           |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/gui``      | ``gui::``      | MCP-GUI related primitives and defines.     |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/proc``     | ``proc::``     | MUF process related primitives.             |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/prog``     | ``prog::``     | Program calling, editing, and compiling.    |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+

+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``fb6/argparse`` | ``argparse::`` | Cmd-line argument parsing.                  |
+------------------+----------------+---------------------------------------------+

NOTE: You should either use ``include "!fb6/prims";`` *or* include one or more
of the namespaced files.  If you include from both, it should still work, but
it misses the point of using namespaces.


Expressions
===========

Basic Math:
- Addition: ``2 + 3``
- Subtraction: ``5 - 2``
- Multiplication: ``5 * 2``
- Division: ``10 / 2``
- Modulo: ``7 % 3``

Numeric Comparisons:
- Equals: ``x == 2``
- Not Equals: ``x != 2``
- Greater Than: ``x > 2``
- Less Than: ``x < 2``
- Greater Than or Equals: ``x >= 2``
- Less Than or Equals: ``x <= 2``

String Comparisons:
- Case sensitive equals: ``x eq "foo"``

Bitwise Math:
- Bitwise AND: ``6 & 4``
- Bitwise OR: ``8 | 4``
- Bitwise XOR: ``6 ^ 4``
- Bitwise NOT: ``~10``
- BitShift Left: ``1 << 4``
- BitShift Right: ``128 >> 3``

Logical Operations:
- Logical OR: ``x == 2 || x == 10``
- Logical AND: ``x > 2 && x < 10``
- Logical XOR: ``x > 2 ^^ x < 10``
- Logical NOT: ``!x``

Note: Logical expressions support shortcutting.
If the left half of a logical ``||`` (OR) is true, the right half isn't evaluated at all.
If the left half of a logical ``&&`` (AND) is false, the right half isn't evaluated at all.
Both sides of a logical ``^^`` (XOR) are always evaluated.

Assignment:
- Simple assignment: ``x = 23``
- Add and assign: ``x += 2`` is the same as ``x = x + 2``
- Subtract and assign: ``x -= 2`` is the same as ``x = x - 2``
- Multiply and assign: ``x *= 2`` is the same as ``x = x * 2``
- Divide and assign: ``x /= 2`` is the same as ``x = x / 2``
- Modulo and assign: ``x %= 2`` is the same as ``x = x % 2``
- Bitwise AND and assign: ``x &= 2`` is the same as ``x = x & 2``
- Bitwise OR and assign: ``x |= 2`` is the same as ``x = x | 2``
- Bitwise XOR and assign: ``x ^= 2`` is the same as ``x = x ^ 2``
- BitShift Left and assign: ``x <<= 2`` is the same as ``x = x << 2``
- BitShift Right and assign: ``x >>= 2`` is the same as ``x = x >> 2``

Array Operations:
- Test if value in array: ``x in [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]``.
- Array subscript: ``x[2]`` returns the third item of the given array in ``x``.
- Array subscript assignment: ``x[2] = 42`` sets the third element of the array
  in ``x`` to ``42``.

Miscellaneous:
- Grouping: ``2 * (3 + 4)``
- Ternary operator: ``x>0 ? 1 : 2`` Returns 1 if x > 0, otherwise returns 2.

These expressions can be combined in surprising ways::

    var y = [[4, 5, 6], 3];
    var z = 1;
    var x = y[0][1] = 43 * (z += 1 << 3);

The intrinsic short-cutting in logical ``&&`` (AND) and ``||`` (OR) operators can
also have other uses.  The ``&&`` (AND) operator can be used to chain successful
calls, such as::

    var success = function1(x) && function2(x) && function3(x);

Each function in the chain is only called if every previous function in the
chain returned a true value.  The value assigned to ``success`` will either be
the first false value returned, or the true value returned by the last call.

The ``||`` (OR) operator is useful in assigning default values::

    var foo = function1(x) || 42;

This will set ``foo`` to the value returned from ``function1()``, unless it is a
value that evaluates as false, in which case ``foo`` is set to ``42`` instead.


Arrays
======

Declaring a list array is easy::

    var listvar = ["First", "Second", "Third", "Forth!"];

To declare an empty list, just use::

    var foo = [];

You can fetch an element from a list using a subscript::

    var a = listvar[2];

Which will set the newly declared variable ``a`` to ``"Third"``:

Setting a list element uses a similar syntax::

    listvar[3] = "foo";

That will change the 4th element (as list indexes are 0-based) of the list in
listvar to ``"foo"``, resulting in listvar containing the list::

    ["First", "Second", "Third", "foo"]

You can append items to an existing list with the ``[]`` construct::

    listvar[] = "bar";

Resulting in listvar containing the list::

    ["First", "Second", "Third", "foo", "bar"]

Deletion of list elements uses ``del()`` like this::

    del(listvar[2]);

Which deletes the 3rd element of the list stored in ``listvar``, resulting in
``listvar`` containing::

    ["First", "Second", "foo", "bar"]

If you need to work with nested lists, ie: lists stored in elements of lists,
you can just add subscripts to the expression.  For example::

    var nest = [
        [8, 7, 6, 5],
        [4, 3, 2],
        ["Foo", "Bar", "Baz"]
    ];

    // Sets a to "Bar", the 2nd element of the list inside the
    // 3rd element of the list in nested.
    var a = nest[2][1];

    // Sets 3rd element of list in the 1st element of nest to 23.
    nest[0][2] = 23;

    // nest now contains:
    // [ [8, 7, 23, 5],  [4, 3, 2],  ["Foo", "Bar", "Baz"] ]

    // Append "baz" to the list in the 3rd element
    // of the list in nest:
    listvar[2][] = "Qux";

    // nest now contains:
    // [ [8, 7, 23, 5],  [4, 3, 2],  ["Foo", "Bar", "Baz", "Qux"] ]

    // Delete the 2nd element of the list in
    // the 3rd element in nest.
    del(nest[2][1]);

    // nest now contains:
    // [ [8, 7, 23, 5],  [4, 3, 2],  ["Foo", "Baz", "Qux"] ]


Dictionaries
============

Dictionaries are a special type of array, where the keys are not necessarily
numeric, and they don't have to be contiguous.  You can use many of the same
functions and primitives with dictionaries that you use with list arrays.  MUV
Dictionaries are functionally like hash tables in other languages.

Defining a dictionary is similar to defining a list array, except you also
specify the keys::

    var mydict = [
        "one" => 1,
        "two" => 2,
        "three" => 3,
        "four" => 4
    ];

To define an empty dictionary, which is distinct from a list, you can use::

    var empty = [=>];

Reading, setting and deleting dictionary elements are very similar to doing
the same with a list array::

    var myvar = mydict["three"];
    mydict["six"] = 6;
    del(mydict["one"]);


Conditionals
============

You can use the ``if`` statement for conditional code execution::

    if (x > 3)
        tell("Greater!");

Which is the same as::

    if (x > 3) {
        tell("Greater!");
    }

If you need an else clause, you can write it like this::

    if (x < 0) {
        tell("Negative!");
    } else {
        tell("Positive!");
    }

For a single statement, you can conditionally execute it using a trailing
conditional ``if`` or ``unless`` clause like::

    tell("Odd!") if (x%2);

or::

    tell("Even!") unless(x%2);

If you need to compare a value against a lot of options, you can use the
``switch`` - ``case`` statement::

    switch (val) {
        case(1) tell("One!");
        case(2) tell("Two!");
        case(3) tell("Three!");
        default tell("Something else!");
    }

The default clause is optional::

    switch (val) {
        case(1) {
            tell("One!");
        }
        case(2) {
            tell("Two!");
        }
        case(3) {
            tell("Three!");
        }
    }

With the ``using`` clause, you can specify a primitive or function that takes
two arguments to use for comparisons.  When the comparison function or
primitive returns true, then a match is found.  When ``using strcmp`` it special
cases the comparison to actually be ``strcmp not``.  The same applies for
``stringcmp``::

    switch (val using strcmp) {
        case("one") {
            tell("First!");
        }
        case("two") {
            tell("Second!");
        }
        case("three") {
            tell("Third!");
        }
    }

You can also specify built-in comparisons like ``eq``, ``in``, or ``=``.  Only the
first ``case`` with a successful match will be executed::

    switch (val using eq) {
        case("one") tell("First!");
        case("two") tell("Second!");
        case("three") tell("Third!");
    }

Unlike in C, ``switch`` statements do not fall-through from one case clause to
the next. Also, you can actually use expressions in the case, not just
constants::

    switch(name(obj) using eq) {
        case(strcat(name(me), "'s Brush")) {
            tell("It's one of your brushes!");
            brushcount++;
        }
        case(strcat(name(me), "'s Fiddle")) {
            tell("It's one of your fiddles!");
            fiddlecount++;
        }
    }

If you use the ``break`` statement inside a case clause, you can exit the case
clause early, and execution resumes after the end of the switch.  If you use a
``continue`` statement inside a case clause, the entire switch statement is
re-evaluated.  This can be useful for, perhaps, running a looping state
machine::

    const FIRST = 1;
    const SECOND = 2;
    const THIRD = 3;
    const FOURTH = 4;
    var state = FIRST;
    switch(state) {
        case(FIRST) {
            state = SECOND;
            do_something();
            continue;
        }
        case(SECOND) {
            state = THIRD;
            do_something_else();
            continue;
        }
        case(THIRD) {
            if (do_something_more()) {
                state = FOURTH;
                continue;
            }
            break;
        }
        case(FOURTH) {
            state = FIRST;
            do_something_special()
            continue;
        }
    }


Loops
=====

There are several types of loops available::

    var i = 10;
    while (i > 0) {
        tell(intostr(i--));
    }

    i = 10;
    until (i == 0) {
        tell(intostr(i--));
    }

    i = 10;
    do {
        tell(intostr(i--));
    } while(i > 0);

    i = 10;
    do {
        tell(intostr(i--));
    } until(i == 0);

    // Count from 1 up to 10, inclusive
    for (i in 1 => 10) {
        tell(intostr(i));
    }

    // Count from 10 down to 1, inclusive
    for (i in 10 => 1 by -1) {
        tell(intostr(i));
    }


You can also iterate arrays/lists/dictionaries like this::

    var letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
    for (var letter in letters)
        tell(letter);

or, to get both index/key and value::

    for (var idx => var letter in ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"])
        tell(cat(idx, letter));


Comprehensions
==============

Using a variation on loops and conditionals, you can quickly create lists and
dictionaries that are mutations of already existing arrays.  The original
array is untouched.

For example, if you have a list of strings in the variable ``words``, you can
create a list of uppercased versions of those words like this::

    var words = ["fee", "fie", "foe", "fum"];
    var uppers = [for (var word in words) toupper(word)]

Similarly, you can mutate a dictionary::

    var prims = [
        "notify" => 2,
        "pop" => 1,
        "swap" => 1,
        "setpropstr" => 3
    ];
    var keywords = [for (var k => var v in prims) cat("KW_", toupper(k)) => v];

You can use any variation of for loop for making comprehensions::

    var odd_thirds = [for (x in 1 => 100 by 3) if (x % 2) x];

You can also filter a list or dictionary by adding an ``if`` or ``unless`` clause::

    var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    var x;
    var odds = [for (x in nums) if (x % 2) x]
    var evens = [for (x in nums) unless (x % 2) x]


Tuple Assignment
================

If an expression or function call returns an array of known size, you can
assign each array item to an individual variable using tuple assignment::

    extern multiple split(s, delim);
    <var a, var b> = split("Hello, World!", " ");

    <a, b> = split("foo=bar", "=");

You can also use tuple assignment inside a loop or comprehension::

    for (<a, b> in list_generator()) {
        tell(cat(b, a));
    }

    var foo = [for (<a, b> in list_generator()) if (a != b) a + b];

 Note that the space between the > and = of the tuple assignment is important!


Exceptions
==========

You can trap errors with the ``try`` - ``catch`` construct::

    try {
        setname(obj, "Foobar");
    } catch (e) {
        tell(e["error"]);
    }

The variable given to the ``catch`` command will, when an error is received,
have a dictionary stored in it with the following values:

``error``
    The error string that was emitted by the MUF instruction that threw an error.

``instr``
    The name of the MUF instruction that threw the error.

``line``
    The MUF line that threw the error.

``program``
    The program that the error was thrown in.  This might not be the same as the
    current program, if the error occurred inside a call.

If you don't care about the exception details, you can just not specify the
variable::

    try {
        setname(obj, "Foobar");
    } catch () {
        tell("Could not set the name.");
    }

If you just want to trap any errors without doing anything, you can just do::

    try {
        setname(obj, "Foobar");
    } catch();

If you need to throw your own custom exception, you can do it like::

    throw("MyError")


MUF Interaction
===============

Sometimes you need to interact with other MUF programs, by reading or storing
data on the MUF stack.  You can do that with the ``top`` and ``push(...)``
constructs. Also, you can specify raw MUF code with the ``muf("...")`` command.

The special variable ``top`` refers to the top of the stack.  You can "pop" the
top of the stack and store it in a variable like::

    var foo = top;

You can "push" a value onto the top of the stack with the ``push(...)`` command::

    push("Hi!");

You can also push multiple values at once::

    push("One", 2, #3, "Fore!");

The ``push(...)`` command will return the value of the last item pushed.:

    var v = push(13, 42);

Will leave ``13`` and ``42`` on the stack, and the value of ``v`` will be set to ``42``.

You can specify raw MUF code by passing it as a string to the ``muf(...)`` command::

    muf('{ "Hello, " args @ }list array_interpret out !');

which will compile directly into MUF as::

    { "Hello, " args @ }list array_interpret out !

IMPORTANT: If you use the ``muf(...)`` command inside a function or in a const
definition, make sure that the MUF code it gives will leave exactly one item
on the stack!

If you need it, you can also use raw MUF code in the using clause of a ``switch``::

    switch (val using muf('"*" strcat smatch')) {
        case("1") tell("Starts with 1");
        case("2") tell("Starts with 2");
        case("3") tell("Starts with 3");
    }


Externs
=======

If new primitives are added to MUF that MUV doesn't know about, or if you need
to call external libraries, you can use an ``extern`` declaration to let MUV
know about how to call it::

    extern void tell(msg);

will tell MUV that a function or primitive named ``tell`` exists that takes one
argument, and returns nothing on the stack.  A call to this will return the
value 0, if it is used in an expression::

    extern single foobar(baz, qux);

will tell MUV that a function or primitive named ``foobar`` exists, that takes
two arguments, and returns a single value on the stack.  When you call this
function, it will return that single stack item to the caller::

    extern multiple fleegul();

will tell MUV that a function or primitive named ``fleegul`` exists, that takes
no arguments, and returns two or more values on the stack.  When you call this
function, it will return a list containing all the returned stack items.

If you need to create an extern for a primitive or function that is problematic
to describe with a normal extern, you can give raw custom MUF code at the end
of the extern to coerce it to a normal form::

    extern single concat(args*) = "array_interpret";

    extern single fmtstr(fmt, args*) = "
        2 try
            array_explode 1 + rotate fmtstring
            depth 0 swap - rotate depth 1 - popn
        catch abort
        endcatch
    ";

The arguments for the extern will be the topmost stack items, with the first
argument being deepest on the stack.  In the case of varargs, like above, the
topmost stack item will be a list containing all the remaining args.  If the
extern is ``void``, then nothing is expected to be left on the stack.  If the
extern is ``single``, then one item is expected to be left on the stack.  If the
extern is ``multiple``, then all items left on the stack will be bundled into a
list to be returned to the caller.

The raw MUF code given is used INSTEAD of a call to the name of the declared
extern.  A normal extern::

    extern single foo();

will insert ``foo`` into the output code where a call to ``foo()`` is made.
An extern with raw MUF like::

    extern single foo() = "bar";

will insert ``bar`` into the output code where a call to ``foo()`` is made.


Directives
==========
There are a number of compiler directives that are (mostly) passed through to
the MUF output code.  These include:

+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Directive        | What it Does                                         |
+==================+======================================================+
| $language "muv"  | Allow future MUCK servers to determine this is MUV.  |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $warn "msg"      | Prints msg as a MUV compiler warning.                |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $error "msg"     | Prints msg as a MUV error and stops compilation.     |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $echo "msg"      | Outputs as the corresponding MUF directive.          |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $author "who"    | Outputs as the corresponding MUF directive.          |

+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $libversion 1.2  | Outputs as the corresponding MUF directive.          |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $include "$foo"  | Outputs as the corresponding MUF directive.          |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| $pragma "foo"    | Outputs as the corresponding MUF directive.          |
+------------------+------------------------------------------------------+


Debugging MUV
=============

When you are debugging a program compiled into MUF from MUV, there are
a few things you should be aware of:

- If you add a ``-d`` to the muv command-line, debugging code will be inserted
  throughout the MUF output. This takes the form of strings that show the MUV
  source file and line that generated the current MUF code.  This then gets
  immediately popped. ie: ``"foo.muv:23" pop`` This is very useful with MUF
  stack traces.
- To prevent namespace collision with the built-in primitives of MUF, the
  non-public functions and variables that MUV generates are renamed slightly
  from what was given in the MUV sources.
- To keep consistent with expressions returning values, some extra ``dup``s
  and ``pop``s will appear throughout the code.  Some of this will get optimized
  out by the MUF compiler, and some won't, but they are very fast primitives
  that shouldn't affect performance *too* horribly.  This is all because you
  can chain expressions in MUV.
- Calls to an ``extern void`` defined primitive or function will be followed
  by a ``0`` to fake that the call returned ``0``.
- Calls to an ``extern multiple`` defined primitive or function will be
  wrapped in ``{`` and ``}list`` to collapse the multiple return values into
  a single list array.
- Because in MUV *all* calls have a return value, for those functions that
  don't have a ``return`` statement, a ``0`` is put at the end of a generated
  function, just in case.

For example, the following MUV source::

    extern void tellme(msg) = "me @ swap notify";
    extern single toupper(s);
    extern multiple stats(who);
    var gvar = 42;
    func foo(bar) {
        tellme(toupper(bar));
        var baz = stats(me);
    }

Will compile to MUF as::

    ( Generated from foo.muv by the MUV compiler. )
    (   https://github.com/revarbat/muv )
    lvar _gvar
    : _foo[ _bar -- ret ]
        var _baz
        "foo.muv:6" pop
        _bar @ toupper me @ swap notify
        "foo.muv:7" pop
        { me @ stats }list dup _baz ! pop
        0
    ;
    : __start
        "me" match me ! me @ location loc ! trig trigger !
        42 _gvar !
        _foo
    ;

There are several things to note here:

- The user declared global variable ``gvar`` has been renamed to ``_gvar``
- The user declared function ``foo`` has been renamed to ``_foo``.
- The user declared scoped variables ``bar`` and ``baz`` have been renamed
  to ``_bar`` and ``_baz``.
- The system variable ``me``, however, remains unchanged.
- Since ``toupper()`` is declared to return a ``single`` value, that value is
  returned unmolested after the call to ``toupper``.
- The call to the ``extern`` declared function ``tellme``, is replaced by the
  code ``me @ swap notify``.
- Since ``stats()`` is declared to return ``multiple`` values, the entire
  expression is wrapped in ``{`` and ``}list`` to collapse all those values
  into a single list array.
- When storing a value in the variable ``baz``, a ``dup`` is performed on the
  value, just in case that value is needed for chained assigns, or in
  another expression.
- Since that value was NOT needed after all, it it ``pop``ed away.
- As the function ``foo()`` ends without a ``return`` statement at the end,
  a ``0`` is pushed onto the stack, so ``foo()`` always returns at least ``0``.
- The ``__start`` function is added to the end of the progam, to perform
  initialization of global variables.  It then calls the user's last
  function.  Note: this means global variables in libraries may not
  get initialized unless you make a public function to specifically
  initialize them.
